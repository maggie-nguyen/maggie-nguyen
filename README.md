## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an undergraduate at KAIST School of Computing, working at the intersection of software engineering and HCI research. I enjoy the full journey of creating from scratch â€” from prototyping to launching real, usable products. Iâ€™ve won two hackathons in Korea and once interned at BLOCK71, one of the most active and influential startup hubs in Southeast Asia. These days, I split my time between coding and research. At the CSTL Lab with Prof. Joseph Seering, I dive into questions around trust, safety, and harmful behavior on online platforms. I also care deeply about climate tech. In the past, at the IMPACT Lab with Prof. Soh Young In, I explored how data science and ESG can inform better urban design and more resilient infrastructure. Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities where I can combine hands-on product development with thoughtful research to create real-world impact.
